Welcome to Temzone API, a RESTful API built with Cloudflare Workers from Temtem Interactive Map.

## Getting started

This guide will help you get up and running the application in just a few minutes.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following tools installed on your development machine:

- Node.js (version [18.13.0](https://nodejs.org/es/download))
- npm (the Node.js package manager, which should be installed with Node.js)
- Wrangler (the Cloudflare Workers CLI, which can be installed with [npm](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update))

### Install the dependencies

To install the dependencies for a Cloudflare Workers project, you'll need to use the npm install command. This command reads the _dependencies_ and _devDependencies_ sections of the [package.json](https://github.com/Temtem-Interactive-Map/Temzone-API/blob/main/package.json) file and installs the packages listed there.

For example, to install all of the dependencies you can run the following command in the project directory:

```
npm install
```

You can also use npm install to install a specific package by providing the package name as an argument. For example:

```
npm install hono
```

This will install the hono package and add it to the dependencies section of the [package.json](https://github.com/Temtem-Interactive-Map/Temzone-API/blob/main/package.json) file.

### Scrape the Official Temtem Wiki

To scrape data from the [Official Temtem Wiki](https://temtem.wiki.gg/wiki/Temtem_Wiki), you can run the following command in the project directory:

```
npm run scraper
```

This command will start the data scraping process and store the scraped data in a local JSON file. You can modify the scraping logic by editing the files in the [scraper](https://github.com/Temtem-Interactive-Map/Temzone-API/tree/main/scraper) folder.

The npm run scraper command accepts additional parameters that you can use to customize the data scraping process. For example, if you only want to run a single scraper instead of all of them, you can specify the name of the scraper as a parameter. The available scrapers are:

- `npm run scraper -- types`: This command will scrape the types data.
- `npm run scraper -- temtem`: This command will scrape the temtem data.
- `npm run scraper -- spawns`: This command will scrape the spawns data.
- `npm run scraper -- saipark`: This command will scrape the saipark data.

### Setting up Firebase

To set up Firebase, you'll need to create a new project in the Firebase console. This is necessary to authenticate users using Firebase Authentication, which enables the application to use different sign in methods.

Here are the steps to set up Firebase:

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com and create a new project. Choose a name and set the location of the project.
2. Once the project is created, navigate to the Authentication tab and enable the sign-in method(s) you want to use. This step is necessary to configure how users will sign in to the application, such as with an email and password, Google account, or other social media accounts.
3. In the `.dev.vars` file of the project, add the following variable:
   - FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID: the ID of the Firebase project.

By completing these steps, the application will be able to authenticate requests using Firebase. Note that the application will use the tokens generated by Firebase to authenticate requests. To validate the tokens, the server will need to know the ID of your Firebase project. That's why you need to add the FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID variable in the .dev.vars file.

### Setting up the database

```
npx wrangler d1 create temzone
npx wrangler kv:namespace create cache
```

To run the application locally, you'll first need to ensure you have a running instance of MySQL. One way to do this is through Docker Compose. To do so, run the following command at the root of the project directory:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start a MySQL instance in a Docker container in detached mode. Once the container is up and running, you'll need to generate a .env file at the root of the project directory and ensure that the following line is present and correct:

```
MYSQL_DATABASE_URL=mysql://temzone:temzone@localhost:3306/temzone
```

This URL uses the username and password _temzone_ and points to the temzone database. Make sure that these values are correct and that the database is running on port 3306 of localhost.

#### Creating the database tables

To create or update the necessary tables in the database, you can run the following command:

```
npm run database:migrate
```

This command will create the tables in the temzone database, based on the database schema defined in the [schema.prima](https://github.com/Temtem-Interactive-Map/Temzone-API/tree/main/prisma/schema.prisma) file. Note that any changes made to the database schema will require running this command again to keep the tables up-to-date.

#### Populating the database

To populate the database with the data scraped from the Official Temtem Wiki, you can run the following command:

```
npm run database:populate
```

Note that this command should only be run after creating the necessary tables in the database using npm run database:migrate. Also, if you run the command again, any markers that have already been added to the database will be ignored and not added again.

### Setting up the application

### Running the development server

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the Cloudflare Workers development server. As you make changes to the code, the development server will automatically reload the Cloudflare Workers to reflect the changes.

### Running the tests

To run the tests for the application, you can use the following command:

```
npm run test
```

The tests are written using the Vitest testing framework, which is included as a devDependency in the project's [package.json](https://github.com/Temtem-Interactive-Map/Temzone-API/blob/main/package.json) file. By default, Vitest will look for files with a _.test.js_ extension in the project directory.
